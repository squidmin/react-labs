# Explanation of the Workflow File

- `name`: This is the name of the workflow, which will appear in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
- `on`: This section defines the GitHub events that trigger the workflow. In this case, it triggers on pull requests to the main branch.
- `jobs`: Defines the jobs that the workflow will execute. This example has a single job named build.
- `runs-on`: Specifies the type of virtual host machine to run the job on. Here, it uses the latest Ubuntu version available on GitHub Actions.
- `strategy.matrix.node-version`: Defines a matrix for the job to run against multiple versions of Node.js, ensuring compatibility across those versions. You can adjust the versions as needed for your project.
- `steps`: Lists the steps the job will execute. It checks out your repository code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies with npm install, and runs tests with npm test.
